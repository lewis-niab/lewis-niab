- 👋 Hi, I’m Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology and a masters in Information Systems. I started in the IT industry in 1978 as a graduate trainee with Unilever Computer Services Limited (UCSL). 
- 🏢 I'm currently working in the IT development team at Niab as a software engineer.  Niab is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👀 My interest is cloud-based Java software application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 👷‍♂️ My main activity is the software support and enhancement of the Distinct, Uniform, Stable (DUS) Admin system and the Contract Management (CM) system, both business critical systems for Niab.
- 🌱 I am training on an ancient Oracle system which, although out of support, is required by DEFRA.  So that I can help when the Oracle legacy applications misbehave.
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a member of the Norfolk Tortoise Club and I have two Hermann's tortoises.

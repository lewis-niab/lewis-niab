- 👋 Hi, My name is Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology (1976) and a masters in Information Systems (2009) from the University of East Anglia. Since 1978 I have worked as a software developer for leading companies including Unilever, IBM, Legal & General, Lloyds Bank, Accenture, London Stock Exchange, JP Morgan, Lloyds of London, Euroclear and The Wellcome Trust.
- 🏢 I'm currently a senior software engineer at Niab, which is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👀 My interest is cloud-based Java software application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 👷‍♂️ My main activity is the software support and enhancement of the Distinct, Uniform, Stable (DUS) Admin system and the Contract Management (CM) system, which are both business critical systems for Niab.
- ☁️ I am working on a cloud-based application to provide Niab staff with access to weather data.
- 🌱 I am also learning to support legacy Oracle systems which, although last actively developed over twenty years ago, amazingly are still being used by Niab. 
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com or lewis.allen@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two large potted money plants (Crassula ovata) at home. These plants are interesting because they have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism#:~:text=Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism%2C%20also%20known,only%20exchange%20gases%20at%20night2.">Crassulacean acid metabolism</a> that is an adaptation to arid conditions that allows them to photosynthesize during the day, but only exchange gases at night.  These plants are not frost hardy, so every year we have a ritual where they go outside in the spring and come back in the house in the autumn. The plants have adapted to their surroundings and are now forty-six years old.

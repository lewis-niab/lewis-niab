- 👋 Hi, My name is Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology (1976) and a masters in Information Systems (2009) from the University of East Anglia.
- 🏢 I'm a senior software engineer at <b>Niab</b>, which is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👨‍💼 I have worked as a software developer since 1979 for leading companies including Unilever, IBM, Legal & General, Lloyds Bank, Accenture, London Stock Exchange, JP Morgan, Lloyds of London, Euroclear and The Wellcome Trust.
- 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ My main activity is the software support and development of the [DUS admin system](https://github.com/NIAB/DUS-Admin-Website) and the [Contract management system](https://github.com/NIAB/tcmweb), which are both business critical.
- 🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑 I work remotely and live in Norfolk UK with a teenage daughter, a small dog, two Hermann's tortoises amd two budgerigars.
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com or lewis.allen@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two large potted money plants ([Crassula ovata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassula_ovata)) at home that are over forty-five years old. These plants have an unusual metabolism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism#:~:text=Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism%2C%20also%20known,only%20exchange%20gases%20at%20night2.">Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)</a>, that is an adaptation to arid conditions, that allows them to photosynthesize during the day, but only exchange gases at night. These plants are not frost hardy, so every spring they are put out in the garden and every autumn they are brought back in again. The money plants are currently <i>IN</i>.

- 👋 Hi, My name is Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology (1976) and a masters in Information Systems (2009) from the University of East Anglia.
- 👨‍💼 I have worked as a software developer for leading companies including Unilever, IBM, Legal & General, Lloyds Bank, Accenture, London Stock Exchange, JP Morgan, Lloyds of London, Euroclear and The Wellcome Trust.
- 🏢 I'm currently a senior software engineer at Niab, which is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👀 My interest is cloud-based Java software application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ My main activity is the software support and enhancement of the Distinct, Uniform, Stable (DUS) Admin system and the Contract Management (CM) system, which are both business critical systems for Niab.
- 🌱 I am also learning to support legacy Oracle systems which, although last actively developed over twenty years ago, are still maintained by Niab. 
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com or lewis.allen@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- 🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑 I live in Norwich in Norfolk UK with a teenage daughter, a small dog, two Hermann's tortoises amd two budgerigars. No chickens.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two large potted money plants ([Crassula ovata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassula_ovata)) at home that are over forty-five years old. These plants are interesting because they have an unusual metabolism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism#:~:text=Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism%2C%20also%20known,only%20exchange%20gases%20at%20night2.">Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)</a>, that is an adaptation to arid conditions that allows them to photosynthesize during the day, but only exchange gases at night.  These plants are not frost hardy, so every spring I put them out in the garden and every autumn they come back in again.

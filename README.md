- 👋 Hi, My name is Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology (1976) and a masters in Information Systems (2009) from the University of East Anglia. Since 1978 I have worked as a software developer for leading companies including Unilever, IBM, Legal & General, Lloyds Bank, Accenture, London Stock Exchange, JP Morgan, Lloyds of London, Euroclear and The Wellcome Trust.
- 🏢 I'm currently a software engineer at Niab, which is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👀 My interest is cloud-based Java software application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 👷‍♂️ My main activity is the software support and enhancement of the Distinct, Uniform, Stable (DUS) Admin system and the Contract Management (CM) system, both business critical systems for Niab.
- 🌱 I am also learning a legacy Oracle system which, although out of support, is required by DEFRA. 
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com or lewis.allen@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My two Hermann's tortoises have just woken from three months in hibernation and are now up and about and eating cabbage.

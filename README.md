- 👋 Hi, My name is Lewis Allen @lewis-niab. I have a degree in Biology (1976) and a masters in Information Systems (2009) from the University of East Anglia. Since 1978 I have worked as a software developer for leading companies including Unilever, IBM, Legal & General, Lloyds Bank, Accenture, London Stock Exchange, JP Morgan, Lloyds of London, Euroclear and The Wellcome Trust.
- 🏢 I'm currently a senior software engineer at Niab, which is a major international centre for plant science, crop evaluation and agronomy.
- 👀 My interest is cloud-based Java software application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 👷‍♂️ My main activity is the software support and enhancement of the Distinct, Uniform, Stable (DUS) Admin system and the Contract Management (CM) system, both business critical systems for Niab.
- 🌱 I am also learning a legacy Oracle system which, although out of support, is required by DEFRA. 
- 📫 You can reach me at lewis.allen@niab.com or lewis.allen@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two potted money plants at home that are forty six years old. They are not frost hardy, so they go outside in the spring and come back in the house in the autumn.
